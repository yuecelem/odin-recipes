        <p>Tortang Giniling is a Filipino ground beef omelette. It is unique in that the omelette is made more like a fritter and is filled with lots of beef and veggies. It is a delicious recipe for breakfast or for a light lunch or snack.</p>
      
        <p>Tortang giniling is a simple Filipino omelette made with ground beef. This omelette isn’t like your traditional omelette where the egg batter is cooked and folded around cheese and other fillings.</p>
        
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
        <ul>
            <li>1 Tbsp oil</li>
            <li>1 onion,dices</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 tomato, dice</li>
            <li>1 lb ground beef</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 c peas</li>
            <li>5 eggs, lightly beaten</li>
            <li>Vegetable or canola oil, for frying</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>In a large skillet, heat oil over medium high heat. Add the onion and garlic and saute until softened, 2-3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the diced tomato to the skillet and continue cooking for 5 minutes, letting the tomatoes release their juices.</li>
            <li>Add the ground beef to the vegetables and saute until browned, 5-7 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the salt and pepper. Mix well. Taste the mixture and adjust the salt and pepper as desired.</li>
            <li>Transfer the mixture to a medium bowl. Add the peas and let the mixture cool slightly.</li>
            <li>Once the meat mixture has cooled, add the beaten eggs and mix well.</li>
            <li>Wipe out the skillet you used for the meat and heat a little oil in it, over medium heat. Reduce the heat to medium low and spoon ¼ c of the egg and beef mixture into the skillet, flatten the mixture and shape it roughly into a 3-4 inch patty. (Depending on the size of your skillet, you may be able to cook more than one omelette at a time. Just be careful not to overcrowd the pan, or flipping the omelettes will be difficult.)</li>
            <li>Cook the omelette for 2-3 minutes on the first side. (If your omelettes cook faster than this, your pan is too hot. Reduce the heat for the next batch.)</li>
            <li>Flip the omelette and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes on the second side, until golden.</li>
            <li>Transfer the omelette to a paper towel-lined plate and continue with the remaining batter. (Keeping the plate with the cooked omelettes in a very low oven will keep them warm until all are made.)</li>
        </ol>
